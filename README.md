# Abstract-Data-Types



These are ADTs I built and coded for my data structures & algorithms class

Abstract Data Types (ADTs):

- List: dynamic, resizable array
- Integer Vector: list implementation
- Linked-List: singly linked-list with a dummy-head node, and without dummy node
- Stack: linked-list implemntation
- Binary Search Tree: Stack implementation
